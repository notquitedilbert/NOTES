# some notes on bash

## an idea for quickly committing these notes
make an alias, function or script to 
- add any new or changed files (`git add .`)
- commit with a message (`git commit -m $1`)
- push to a repo (`git push`)

### problems with it
- doesn't support multi line commits (this is probalby ok for now)
